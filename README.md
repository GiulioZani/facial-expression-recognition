## Installation
Make sure you have at least python 3.9 installed.
If the `dlpm` folder is empty, you need to clone the repository.

```bash

Then install the dependecies.
```bash
pip install -r dlpm/requirements.txt
```
```bash

`dlpm` is a framework for running and testing deep learning models. The code relevant to this specific task is contained in the `dl` folder.

## Download the dataset
The dataset can be downloaded form [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tom99763/affectnethq) The size is 9GB.

```
python -m dl.preprocess --dataset_path=<unzipped folder containing data> --destination_folder=<preprocessed location>
```


## Test the model:
First you need to edit the `dl/models/resnet/default_parameters.json` file and set the `data_location` parameter to the location of the preprocessed dataset. Then run:
```
python -m dlpm test resnet
```
